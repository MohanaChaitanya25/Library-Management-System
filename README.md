# Library-Management-System
## ABSTRACT
A library management system is software that is designed to help the librarian manage and maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates. This system completely automates all the library activities like adding/updating members, adding/updating books, and managing check-in specifications for the systems based on the clientâ€™s statement of need, and so on.
